Partial Loading and Training on All Data
The partial loading technique you're using with memory mapping (mmap_mode='r') in your batch generator is an efficient way to handle large datasets. It allows the model to load and process only a portion of the data at a time, thus conserving memory. Here's how it ensures that all data is used over the course of training:

Cycling Through Batches: The generator cycles through the .npy files in each epoch. This means that every time an epoch starts, it begins again from the first batch and goes through each one sequentially.

Shuffling for Generalization: By shuffling the files at the start of each epoch, your model sees the data in a different order each time. This randomness helps in generalizing the model better.

Understanding the Output
Regarding the output 16/21 [=====================>........] - ETA: 1:00 - loss: 0.7803 - accuracy: 0.7330:

Epoch 1/50: This indicates that the model is currently in the first epoch of the total 50 epochs planned for training.
16/21: This shows the progress within the current epoch. It means the model has processed 16 batches out of a total of 21 in this epoch.
ETA: 1:00: Estimated Time of Arrival. This is an estimate of how long it will take to finish the current epoch. Here, it's about 1 minute remaining.
loss: 0.7803: The current average loss over the batches processed in this epoch.
accuracy: 0.7330: The current average accuracy over the batches processed in this epoch.
Training on Every Data
Steps Per Epoch: The 21 in 16/21 represents the total number of steps (or batches) per epoch. This is determined by the steps_per_epoch parameter in model.fit. It's calculated based on your dataset size and batch size.
Covering All Data: In your case, if steps_per_epoch is set correctly, then yes, over 50 epochs, the model should theoretically train on every piece of data in your dataset. However, because of the shuffling and the way batches are constructed, some duplication of data across epochs is possible, especially if your total data size is not a multiple of the batch size.
Ensuring Complete Coverage: To make sure every data point is used for training, you need to ensure that your steps_per_epoch parameter correctly represents the total number of batches in your dataset. If you have a total of N data points and a batch size of B, then steps_per_epoch should be set to ceil(N / B).
Keep in mind that training deep learning models, especially on large datasets, is often about statistical coverage rather than ensuring that literally every single data point is used. The random shuffling and cycling through the data typically provide sufficient exposure for the model to learn effectively.

after ecah epoch the batch_generator is called  ?

The batch_generator function you've created is a Python generator, and it works a bit differently from regular functions. It's not that the batch_generator is called anew at the start of each epoch. Instead, it's more accurate to say that the generator continues to yield batches continuously and seamlessly across epochs.

Here's a simplified overview of how it works in the context of your training process:

Generator Initialization: When you initialize the generator (data_generator = batch_generator(...)), it doesn't actually generate any data yet. It just sets up the generator.

First Call to Generator: When you start training with model.fit, it calls the generator for the first time. The generator then enters its loop, where it starts to yield batches of data.

During an Epoch: As the training progresses through an epoch, model.fit keeps requesting batches from the generator. The generator picks up from where it left off in its code, yields the next batch, and then pauses again, waiting for the next request.

End of an Epoch: When an epoch finishes, the generator doesn't restart or reset. It simply remains paused, waiting for the next request for a batch.

Start of a New Epoch: As the new epoch starts, model.fit requests another batch, and the generator continues from where it paused, yielding the next batch in sequence.

Cycling Through Data: Because of the way your generator is coded, once it reaches the end of the dataset (the end of your .npy files), it will shuffle the file list and start again from the first file, thereby starting a new cycle through the data. This seamless continuation happens regardless of epoch boundaries.

Continuous Generation: This process continues throughout all epochs. The generator has no knowledge of epochs; it simply yields batches whenever requested until the training process stops.

In summary, the generator maintains its state between epochs and continues to provide batches in a continuous stream. This is one of the powerful aspects of Python generators in the context of handling large datasets for machine learning.
